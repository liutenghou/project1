%% Description:
%% This file contains the natural language machinery for the 312
%% Prolog Expert System Shell.  To run this file, you should instead
%% load that file (which expects and tries to load this file).
%% However, this file CAN be run independently for debugging.
%% You'll probably want to use "try_parse/0" as the entry point.
%%
%% Approximately speaking, rules are introduced by "rule:" and end
%% with a period.  A rule can be a sentence or a condition like 
%% if <sentence> then <result>.  Sentences have a noun phrase for a
%% subject and a verb phrase.  The noun phrase can be "it" or a noun
%% with optional descriptive adjectives.  The verb phrase can be "is"
%% or "are", in which case it is followed by a noun phrase or an
%% adjective; "has", "have", "contain", or "contains", in which case
%% it is followed by any series of noun phrases joined together by 
%% "and"; or any other verb, in which case, it is also followed by
%% a conjunction of noun phrases.  Words themselves are defined 
%% (with their part of speech) below.  Words can also be "defined"
%% in place by surrounding them with " characters and tagging them
%% with a type.  For example: it is a "adj:rowdy" "n:game".  This
%% sentence would be recognized properly even though "rowdy" and
%% "game" are not defined below.  The word defined may be any text
%% (even with spaces, although not with a "), but the type must
%% be one of "n", "adj", "adv", and "v" for noun, adjective, adverb,
%% and verb, respectively.

% This file is broken into sections using banners like the 
% "Introduction" banner that begins this section. The key sections are:
% - Reading input into term lists: read_sentence/1 reads 
%   a sentence (up to a period) from standard input into 
%   a list of words represented as atoms.  
% - Grammar: rule/3 (gen'd from the DCG rule/1) parses natural 
%   language into a PESS rule structure; try_parse/0 prompts you 
%   for a sentence and then tries to parse and gloss it.  
% - Glossing: plain_gloss/2 translates a PESS rule structure back 
%   into natural language ("glosses" the rule) 
% - Vocabulary: defines gobs of bird-related vocabulary

%% Grammar for 312 PESS rules + debugging machinery             %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This section includes the grammar for parsing PESS rules from English
% sentences along with some debugging machinery to for understanding
% the parsing process.

% The next section contains a related set of predicates for glossing
% (i.e., translating into natural language) PESS rules, the reverse
% process to the one performed in this section.

% There are some notes on rules and goals in 312pess.pl's section on
% asking, solving, and proving. However, it is worth repeating some of
% that information here and expanding on how goals (in particular)
% relate to English sentences.
%
% A rule is of the form rule(Head, Body), where Head is a single goal
% (instance of attr/3) while Body is a (possibly empty) list of
% goals. A rule "rule(Head, Body)" means something like "if Body then
% Head". Goals, AKA attributes, have the form attr(Type, Value,
% SubAttributes). Type is one of: 
% - is_a (indicating a noun/is-a relationship) 
% - has_a (indicating a noun/containment/possession relationship) 
% - is_like (indicating an adjective/descriptive relationship) 
% - is_how (indicating an adverb/descriptive relationship) 
%
% Value may be anything. SubAttributes is a (possibly empty) list of
% "attached" attributes -- that is, further attributes describing this
% one.
%
% For example: its very sharp claws slowly tear the paper
% would be described as:
% attr(has_a, claws,                % its claws
%  [attr(is_like, sharp,            % claws like what? sharp
%     [attr(is_how, very, [])]),    % how sharp? very
%   attr(does, tear,                % do what? tear
%     [attr(is_how, slowly, []),    % tear how? slowly
%      attr(is_a, paper, [])])])    % tear what? paper
%      
% Note that glossing this (see the plain_gloss predicate) will
% result in an equivalent "canonical" form:
% it has very sharp claws that slowly tear paper

% The actual words (nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and most verbs) that the
% parser is capable of understanding are enumerated in a separate, long,
% but simple section below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% debugging code %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Debugging predicate for quick test parsing of a rule.
try_parse :- try_parse(P),
        write('Parsed structure is: '), write(P), nl, nl,
        plain_gloss(P, Text),
        write('Understood: '), write_sentence(Text), nl.

% Debugging predicate for quick test parsing of a rule.
try_parse(P) :- read_sentence(Sent), rule(P, Sent, []).

%% A sample parsed sentence for testing.  Should mean:
%% It very slowly and carefully eats languidly flying very very 
%% small insects and brown worms.
big_test_term(X) :- X =
[attr(does, eat, 
      [attr(is_how, slowly, [attr(is_how, very, [])]), 
       attr(is_how, carefully, []), 
       attr(is_a, insect, [attr(is_like, flying, 
                                [attr(is_how, languidly, [])]), 
                           attr(is_like, small, 
                                [attr(is_how, very, 
                                      [attr(is_how, very, [])])])]),
